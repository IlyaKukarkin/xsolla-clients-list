## Tests

Lint tests:

> run linting test

```shell
$ npm run lint
```

Result of lint testing:

![lint](https://i.gyazo.com/50b9917e15356d9a3d70e628b87e60fd.png)

No lint errors in project!

Unit tests:

> run tests

```shell
$ npm run test
```

Using vue-test-utils we can create local version of our store and test existing mutations.

For example: create client -> add him to the local store -> check store state

```javascript
test('add client into store', () => {
  const localVue = createLocalVue();                     // Calling local vue
  localVue.use(Vuex);                                    // Use Vuex
  const store = new Vuex.Store(cloneDeep(storeConfig));  // Create local clients store
  expect(store.state.clients).toEqual({});               // Check if store empty
  let client = {surname: 'Ivanov', name: 'Ivan', patronymic: 'Ivanovich', email: 'ivan777@gmail.com', phone: '89194651456', address: 'Lenina 50', series: 1638, number: 164162, birthDate: '18-11-1970'};
  store.commit('CREATE_CLIENT', {client: client});       // Add to the store client

  // Check if created client in the store
  expect(store.state.clients).toEqual({'undefined': {'address': 'Lenina 50', 'birthDate': '18-11-1970', 'email': 'ivan777@gmail.com', 'name': 'Ivan', 'number': 164162, 'patronymic': 'Ivanovich', 'phone': '89194651456', 'series': 1638, 'surname': 'Ivanov'}});
});
```

Each entity have 3 mutations - create, update and delete. That means for our 4 entities (Clients, Flats, Cars, Contracts) there will be in total 12 tests

Result of unit testing:
